This python project is simply a program developmental process that shows the use of python programming language to create, update and populate pdf files using standard programming practices in python.

The main.py file shows the development for one pdf page while the main_2.py file shows the code base for developing a pdf document with multiple pages.

The resources used include:

1. PyCharm
2. A csv file titled "Topics.csv" used to populate the headers for the pdf files generated and the number of pages each topic is supposed to be assigned.
3. The pandas and fpdf modules in python
